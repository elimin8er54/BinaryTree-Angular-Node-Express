# Binary Tree README
> A very basic Binary Tree visual using Angular

Binary Tree Typescript in src/client/javascript/binary-tree.ts
Since I know a lot about React, Typescript, Node, and Express, I decided to make a very quick Angular project.

Since I know React already it was fairly easy to grasp.

Although the binary-tree.ts code has a lot of functionality, the Angular visuals aspect only allow adding of nodes to the tree.
